# Relative Prime

For this challenge, you are supposed to create an efficient function that determines if a group of numbers are relatively prime. Two numbers are relatively prime if they share no factors with each other.

For Example:

- 2 and 3 are relatively prime because they do not share any factors
- 14 9 25 are relatively prime, even though they are not prime, they do not share any factors

The input file (`input.txt`) will contain a line by line lists of numbers. If the number are relatively prime you should output the smallest factor they all share, otherwise output true. The correct answers are in the file labeled `output.txt`

Please create a folder called your name under the problem and put all of your code in there.
