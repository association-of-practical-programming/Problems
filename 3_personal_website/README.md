# Personal website
Many people have websites. So should you. For this challenge, create a website for yourself.
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the content, style, and code for your site. Here are some examples
of other peoples websites.

- [Gary Sheng](http://www.garysheng.com/)
- [David Walsh](https://davidwalsh.name/about-david-walsh)

Once you are done, just make a branch and push it to github. Then make a PR on github. Try to make a folder for your site and put one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JS file in it. If you have images and things like that make sure that they are in the folder as well.

We are going to make a website for the club and try to make a page for everyone, so this website you make about yourself will actually be on the internet!

As always, if you have any questions, email or slack me and I would be happy to answer.
