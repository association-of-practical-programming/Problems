# 3 Sum

Given an array of n integers and an integer k determine whether there is a combination of 3 numbers that add up to k.

For example the array [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ] does not have a solution to k=4 but does have a solution to k = 6 (1 + 2 + 3)

The program should output false if there is no numbers that satisfies the property and output the actual numbers in ascending order if there are numbers that satisfies the property.

The `input.txt` file contains multiple lines of inputs for this challenge. Each line has a list of numbers separated by spaces. The first number is the number which you are looking for the other numbers to add up to.

The `output.txt` file contains what the output for each input should be. You can use this file to test your own input.
